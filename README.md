First, I use the linear search algorithm to find the bus that is at the location where the user is and where the user wants to go.
And I use the find min algorithm to find the bus that will arrive at the destination faster. It's an algorithm as part of the selection sort algorithm. And I seve all the buses that could go to the destination point. And I used HashMaps and HashSets and their many useful methods.
